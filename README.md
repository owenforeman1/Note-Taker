# Note-Taker

## Description

I wanted to fix the note app so the front end and backend are connected. I wanted to add the routing for each function of the note app. I was confused with each objects id's at first but I got it eventually and I had trouble getting the delete to work at first. If you need a good note taking app this one does all that you need. I learned a lot about a full stack application and how the backend is connected to the front end.
